      "\n",
      ", The United States is a highly developed country, accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP, and is the world's largest economy., By value, the United States is the world's largest importer and the second-largest exporter of goods., Although its population is only 4.2% of the world's total, it holds 29.4% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share held by any country., Making up more than a third of global military spending, it is the foremost military power in the world; and it is a leading political, cultural, and scientific force internationally.[23]]\n"
